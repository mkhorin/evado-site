        <h1>Access control</h1>
        <p>
          Evado Declarative Framework controls resource access rights using a role-based system (RBAC).
          This allows you to configure convenient and flexible restriction rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permissions in the RBAC system describe what can be done in the app.
          For example, create articles, update articles, delete comments and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles group permissions into one.
          For example, an author has permissions to create and edit articles,
          and a Moderator role has permission to delete comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assignments bind roles to users.
          For example, if Adam user is assigned the Author role, then Adam
          will be able to do what Author is allowed to do (create and edit articles).
        </p>
        <p>
          Go to Administration module and select Security -> Roles menu.
          By default, the app has two roles.
          Admin role has full access to app functionality.
          Guest role does not have any permissions and is assigned automatically to unauthenticated users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blog requires additional roles.
          Writer role allows you to create and manage your own articles and photos.
          Editor role allows you to manage all Office data.
        </p>
        <h4>Writer role</h4>
        <p>
          Create a Writer role. Add Office module and Upload files permissions.
          Go to Meta permissions menu and create permission to manage your own articles and photos:
        </p>
        <img class="image-view" src="../images/blog/meta-permission-01.png" alt="Metadata permissions">
        <p>
          Allow type allows action. Deny type prohibits action.
          For example, Allow to create or Deny to create.
          Targets field defines metadata that the permission affects.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rule defines the possibility of applying permission.
          This happens at the time of requesting access to target.
          Meta author rule checks whether user is creator of the object that he is trying to access.
          If there was no rule, a user with Writer role could have full access to any article.
        </p>
        <h4>Editor role</h4>
        <p>
          Create an Editor role.
          Add Office module and Upload files permissions.
          Go to Meta permissions menu.
          Create <b>full access</b> permission to Office data and add Editor role to it.
        </p>
        <div class="alert-warning alert">
          Click <b>Restart security</b> button on the top panel for changes to take effect.
        </div>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>
          Go to <b>Users</b> menu.
          Create a <b>Walter</b> user and add the Writer role to him.
          Create an <b>Edward</b> user and add the Editor role to him.
          Check <b>Verified</b> box to consider email address verified and allow user to work in system.
          Now you can log in as a new user and check the assigned roles in action.
